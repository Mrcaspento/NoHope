## the struggle

this was one of the hardest assignments I have attempted to complete so far, for the longest time i had trouble creating the quiz container. Then I ran into issues of populating the containers using the DOM. Eventually I got it to start working even adding a next button after each question is answered. I have run into a problem with the timer though.
